"""Chipdb generation, and the placeholder a tools-only pack leaves behind.

One chipdb-<die>.bin is generated per die of the manifest
chipdb-parts.json (single source of parts, shared with
nix/windows/default.nix): every part of a die routes on that die's chipdb,
so xc7a35t and xc7a50t parts share one file. The set is guarded by the
identity stamp so that bins from another toolchain are never reused.

A release package carries those bins in share/nextpnr/himbaechel/xilinx/
(CHIPDB_SUBDIR), where the engine looks for them, next to chipdb-id.txt.
``--no-chipdb`` is a local tools-only pack: that directory gets the README
this module writes and no bins, and that tree is not a release package.
Run as a script to write that placeholder into a directory:

    python3 -m pack.chipdb <package>/share/nextpnr/himbaechel/xilinx
