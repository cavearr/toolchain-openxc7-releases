"""XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json: which parts a package supports and which it built.

Every package carries this document at its root, and the release
publishes the same bytes under the same name. The package ships the
chipdb files where the engine looks for them,
``share/nextpnr/himbaechel/xilinx/``, so a part number is all the engine
needs: an entry names no file.

The naming is Vivado's. ``xc7a200t`` is the device, ``fbg484`` the
package and ``3`` the speed grade; ``xc7a200tfbg484-3`` is the **part**
and ``xc7a200tfbg484`` its **base part**. The index is keyed by the part,
because which parts share a chipdb file is an implementation detail of
the engine (apio#947): one file serves every part of a die -- every
package and speed grade of the device, and of the devices that are the
same die (an xc7a35t is an xc7a50t).

This module owns the format (schema, note, validation):
``pack.chipdb_assets`` writes the document, L1 checks a package against
the bins it describes, and scripts/asset-check.sh checks a published
release against it -- one validator, three callers.

The schema number is the contract (apio#1071, apio#1070). A package
carries one engine, so a reader asserts the number and already knows the
binary. Schema 8 is the himbaechel engine with the chipdb files inside
the package. Packages up to the 2026-10-01 release kept them in a
``chipdb/`` directory at the root, named each one in the index and passed
it with ``--chipdb``; since then they live in the engine's own share
directory, the index names none and the command line has no ``--chipdb``.
Both carry schema 8, so the document itself tells them apart:
``names_chipdb_files()``. An entry has no engine field, no download
fields and no file name.
