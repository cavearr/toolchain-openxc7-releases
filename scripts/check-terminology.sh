# In an FPGA ecosystem the words below read as physical pads, and using
# them for "a fixed version" confused the apio maintainer badly enough
# that the project banned them everywhere: code comments, commit
# messages, workflow names, docs, issue replies, release notes. Say
# version, tag, revision, or "bump the version".
#
# Only the unambiguous forms are gated. Bare "pin"/"pins" is legitimate
# and common here -- package_pins.csv, PACKAGE_PIN, e2e/gen_xdc.py, the
# DI/WE discussions in the test READMEs -- so it is NOT matched: a check
# that cried wolf on real pads would be turned off within a week.
#
# Excluded by name: doc/, the screenshots of the original toolchain
# documentation by Obijuan (the document itself is in the history).
