# build-info.sh -- compose the ecosystem-convention BUILD-INFO.json.
#
# Every package carries a BUILD-INFO.json at its root describing the
# package and the build that produced it (the FPGAwars convention, see
# tools-oss-cad-suite, which apio's repackaging reads). Usage:
#
#   scripts/build-info.sh <target-platform> <date YYYY-MM-DD> <file-name> <out-file>
#
# The yosys-release-tag (the runtime matching key, apio#927) is the release
# of the installed oss-cad-suite the build validated against: the VERSION file
# of a YosysHQ suite holds its date in digits (ci-install-oss-cad-suite.sh
# checks it against the single literal YOSYS_RELEASE_TAG of
# build-pre-release.yaml). GITHUB_* envs identify the build; local developer
# builds fall back to git so they get an honest BUILD-INFO too. The
# eigen-version is evaluated from the flake (see below). When
# GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY is set the JSON is also exported to the run summary
# (same convention).
