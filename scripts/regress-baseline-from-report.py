"""Refresh a platform's regression baseline from a CI regress-report.json.

After a toolchain revision bump the L2 gate fails exactly as designed: every
baseline was recorded with the previous revision and metric drift is gated.
The authoritative numbers for the new revision are the ones the CI package
itself measured, and the platform jobs publish them as the
`regress-report-<platform>` artifact (regress-report.json). This tool turns
that report into the baseline update the harness's --update-baseline would
have written on that runner, so the refresh is reproducible and reviewable
in one diff instead of being retyped by hand.

Recorded: every entry whose flow completed and whose expectations held
(status OK/WARN/FAIL-by-drift, or DRIFT from a --report-only run, i.e.
it has metrics and no findings).
Never recorded: broken flows, violated expectations (findings), SKIPs.
The env (tool versions) comes from the report's `tools`.

--only narrows that to a single test and leaves every other entry of the
file untouched. That is how a test added to the suite gets its baseline on
a platform only CI can measure (windows under wine): its entry is NEW there
until some run records it, and recording it must not drag in the runner's
run-to-run pnr_seconds spread on the 35 entries that already have one.

e.g. scripts/regress-baseline-from-report.py darwin-arm64 regress-report.json
     scripts/regress-baseline-from-report.py --only sonata-blinky \\
         windows-amd64 regress-report.json
Prints every metric that moved beyond 5% (the human-review list) and writes
regress/baselines/<platform>.json.
