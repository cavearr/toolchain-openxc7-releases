# regress.sh -- run the regression suite against a package.
#
#   scripts/regress.sh <package.tgz|package-dir> [options]
#
# Options are passed straight through to the harness:
#   --list               show the test catalogue and exit (no package needed)
#   --test <name>        restrict to one test (repeatable)
#   --part <part>        restrict to one part (repeatable)
#   --tier <n>           run tiers up to n
#   --tag <tag>          run tests carrying this tag
#   --update-baseline    record the measured values as the new baseline
#   --report-only        metric drift against the baseline is reported (DRIFT)
#                        and does not fail; a broken flow, an expectation or a
#                        clocked design without fmax still fail (upstream nightly)
#   --json <file>        write the report as JSON
#   --markdown <file>    write the report as markdown (CI job summary)
#   --keep               keep the work directory for inspection
#   --chipdb-dir <dir>   optional. A release package already carries its
#                        chipdb (share/nextpnr/himbaechel/xilinx/ since schema
#                        9). A local --no-chipdb tree does not: pass the
#                        bins and the suite reads them. Ignored for the files
#                        the package already has.
#
# A test is a directory under regress/tests/ with a test.json declaration —
# see regress/README.md. Adding one never requires touching code.
#
# Needs yosys on PATH — from the required oss-cad-suite version, the same one apio
# installs, so that measurements are comparable with what users get.
