  # The himbaechel xilinx uarch of openXC7/nextpnr (apio#1070): the engine
  # the package moves to from the nextpnr-xilinx fork. The revision in
  # nix/revisions.json is main after the tag 1.0.0 (e860c9c8), which has no
  # newer tag yet.
  # Over 1.0.0, up to c68c1358, it brought a shared LUT that drives a CARRY4
  # S input placed at the carry site (#52), IFFDELMUXE3.P0 for an IDDR fed
  # by an IDELAYE2 (#58), ISERDES OFB_USED with the OFB pairs kept off the
  # _SING tiles (#62), the BSCAN site found by JTAG chain (#29) and the
  # -o preplaced / -o prerouted / -o holdbufs replay options (#30).
  # Since c68c1358 (26f5e17a): the RAMB data-in setup/hold follow each
  # port's WRITE_MODE (#65), the ODDR on a pad's tristate path (#72), RAM32M
  # / RAM64M contents and falling-edge SRLs (#70), RAMB INIT/SRVAL and the
  # 72-bit SDP write width (#69), the MMCM/PLL counters and loop filter
  # (#68), DSP48E1 inputs tied in the tile (#66), cascaded RAMB36 pairs
  # (#67), no HP-bank OBUF glue under an OLOGIC cell (#78), TMDS_33 and
  # LVDS_25 pairs, LVCMOS33 drive and IDDR Q3/Q4 init as Vivado writes them
  # (#71), and named errors where it crashed or aborted (#53, #54, #55,
  # #57). #65 changes the chipdb generator (the RAMB timing variants per
  # write mode); the constids do not change.
  # Since 26f5e17a (8006fbc6, merged 2026-10-10): a width-9 RAMB36E1 port
  # presents its parity on DIPxDIP1 as well (#63), routing does not go
  # through an unbound BUFGCTRL (#81), the chipdb generator reads virtex7
  # timing from the database instead of copying artix7 (#73), and the
  # stretch demo vc707-ocaml is in the tree (#35). #82 is CI only.
  # The constids do not change. ZERO local patches.
  #
  # It installs as bin/nextpnr-xilinx, the name apio runs (the engine is
  # named in XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json, not by the executable), and it
  # takes another command line than the fork: the part in --device, the
  # XDC and the FASM as uarch options (-o xdc=, -o fasm=), one chipdb per
  # die in --chipdb, and the metrics in --report.
  #
  # The chipdb files are not built here: pack/chipdb.py generates one per
  # die of the manifest with the generator of this very source tree
  # (passthru.chipdbGenerator) and this build's bbasm, and the release
  # publishes them. So the build is told about no device at all.
