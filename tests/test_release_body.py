"""Tests for the body rewrite make-pre-release-stable does on promotion.

build-pre-release writes the body for a PRE-release, so it ends with a
note saying the release will be deleted in a few days. Promotion drops
that section -- and only it -- from the body of the release it publishes.

The workflow carries the program inline, so the tests run THAT program,
extracted from the file: a change to the workflow is a change to what is
tested.

openXC7 toolchain — 2026-08-30. Validated by CI (package gate and
regression suite on the three platforms).

### On-demand chipdb
The three packages ship **no chipdb**: their `chipdb/` directory
holds a README.txt.

### Build info
**`openxc7-toolchain-linux-x86-64-20260830.tgz`**
```json
{
  "package-version": "0.9.3",
  "note": "### Pre-release note is not a heading here"
}
```

### Pre-release note
This daily release was created as a pre-release and will be deleted
after a few days.
* To KEEP it around for longer testing: uncheck `Set as a
  pre-release` (no side effects — it just survives the cleanup).
* To PUBLISH it (after testing it for real): run the
  `make-pre-release-stable` workflow with this tag (verifies the assets,
  marks the release stable + latest), then update apio's
  remote-config by hand (apio#927).
