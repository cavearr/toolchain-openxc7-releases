This Apio package contains the Xiling architecture support of Apio. It is based on selected binaries from the [openXC7 project](https://github.com/openxc7):
an open source toolchain for **Xilinx 7-series FPGAs** (Artix-7 and friends) and is not intended for standalone
operation but as part of [Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio).

This repository does not develop the toolchain itself — it **builds and packages**
using [Nix](https://nixos.org), and publish one Apio package tarball per Apio supported platform,

## What is inside a package

| Component                                 | Upstream                                             | Role in the flow                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

Synthesis is **not** part of this package: it comes from `yosys`. apio users
get it in the `oss-cad-suite` package
([tools-oss-cad-suite](https://github.com/FPGAwars/tools-oss-cad-suite)), which
repackages a release of [YosysHQ's oss-cad-suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build);
the CI validates this package with that same yosys.

The ten chipdb files travel inside the package. The linux-x86-64 package
with them is 135 MB (135,265,549 bytes). Release `2026-09-25` (schema 7,
chipdb downloaded per die) was 92 MB (linux), 77 MB (darwin) and 73 MB
(windows).

## Supported Boards and FPGAs

For latest information see [Apio supported boards](https://fpgawars.github.io/apio/docs/supported-boards/) and
[Apio supported FPGAs](https://fpgawars.github.io/apio/docs/supported-fpgas/). FPGAs that are supported by
Openxc7 but not by Apio can easily be added in the [Apio Definition Package repo](https://github.com/fpgawars/apio-definitions).

Every package ships the prjxray database of three 7-series families and one
chipdb file per die below, in `chipdb/`. Every device and package of a die
shares that file (an xc7a35t is an xc7a50t die):

| Family         | Die (chipdb) | Devices              | Footprints                                         | Boards (examples)                            |

Zynq support is **PL-only**: the toolchain produces the fabric bitstream
(loaded over JTAG); the ARM PS boots on its own. Kintex-7 is work in progress
(its differential-input bits are missing upstream).

`chipdb-parts.json` is the **single source of truth** for that list: it is read by
the packer, by the Windows build (which database families to ship) and by the CI
assertions. Adding a board whose footprint already exists in the prjxray database
is a one-line change there.

## Building the packages from source (developers)

The build is reproducible with **Nix** (every flake input at a fixed revision). There is no
cross-compilation between Linux and macOS — each is built natively on its own
machine — while the Windows package **is** cross-compiled from Linux, because
Nix does not run on Windows.

### Linux / macOS (native)

```bash
nix develop .#pack                                   # packaging shell
python3.12 openxc7-pack.py                           # -> openxc7-toolchain-<platform>-<date>.tgz
python3.12 openxc7-pack.py --no-chipdb               # local tools-only tree, no bins
```

The default pack is the release pack: it generates the chipdb of every die
of the manifest, or copies one already generated (`OPENXC7_CHIPDB_SEED`,
which must carry this toolchain's `chipdb-id.txt`), and the tarball ships
those files in `chipdb/`. `--no-chipdb` (or `OPENXC7_NO_CHIPDB=1`) leaves a
`README.txt` there and no bins. Use it for local iteration. A release
package is what the default pack produces, with the chipdb files already
in `chipdb/`.

The first `nix develop` builds the whole toolchain and takes a while (tens of
minutes); later ones take seconds. `nix develop` (without `.#pack`) gives the
full development shell; `.#pack` is the lighter profile the packer actually
needs.

Apple clang rejects one call in the xilinx FASM writer that GCC accepts: a
`std::string` passed to variadic `log_error` (the diagnostic for a LUT-RAM
whose clock inversion disagrees with its half-slice). The derivation adds
`-Wno-non-pod-varargs` on Darwin only, so the sources stay as upstream wrote
them. That call is not on the path that writes a bitstream.

Generating the chipdb is the slow part: one run of the uarch's generator
(`himbaechel/uarch/xilinx/gen/xilinx_gen.py`, from the nextpnr source tree the
package is built from; the packaging shell exports it as
`NEXTPNR_XILINX_CHIPDB_GEN`) and one `bbasm` per die — about 14 minutes for
the ten dies one at a time, 9 with `OPENXC7_CHIPDB_JOBS=10` under the default
memory budget (a 20-core Linux server), and from 1 to 12.4 GB of memory each
(`xc7z100` is the biggest). The `.bin` files are **platform independent and
byte-identical**, so they can be generated once and reused:

| Variable                | Meaning                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENXC7_PACK_DATE`     | Force the package date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), instead of today |
| `OPENXC7_CHIPDB_SEED`   | Directory of prebuilt `.bin` files to reuse (with the `chipdb-id.txt` of this toolchain) |
| `OPENXC7_CHIPDB_JOBS`   | Dies generated at once (default 1)                      |
| `OPENXC7_CHIPDB_MEM_GB` | Memory budget of those jobs (default 14: `xc7z045` and `xc7z100` never run together) |
| `OPENXC7_NO_CHIPDB`     | `1` packs a local tools-only tree (same as `--no-chipdb`) |
| `OPENXC7_PARTS_INDEX`   | The document to embed as `XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json`      |
| `OPENXC7_BUILD_INFO`    | The `BUILD-INFO.json` to embed (`scripts/build-info.sh`) |

> **Caveat:** when you change the toolchain revisions, remove `dist/`
> before packing (`chmod -R u+w dist && rm -rf dist`). A chipdb file built
> against a different revision of nextpnr or of the database is incompatible,
> and nextpnr cannot always tell: the identity stamp (`chipdb-id.txt`) is what
> keeps the packer from reusing one.

### Windows (cross-compiled from Linux)

```bash
nix build .#packages.x86_64-linux.openxc7-windows-amd64-tools
```

The result is deliberately a **tools-only tree** without `chipdb/`. CI copies
the bins and `chipdb-id.txt` from the single `chipdb.yml` job into `chipdb/`,
embeds the `XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json` that job wrote, then creates the tarball.
Those are the same bins the Linux and macOS packs seed. To reproduce that
assembly locally:

```bash
cp -aL result package-win && chmod -R u+w package-win
mkdir -p package-win/chipdb
cp /path/to/chipdb-bins/*.bin /path/to/chipdb-bins/chipdb-id.txt package-win/chipdb/
cp /path/to/XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json package-win/XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json
CHIPDB_SOURCE=restored-from-cache CHIPDB_ID="$(cat package-win/chipdb/chipdb-id.txt)" \
  bash scripts/build-info.sh windows-amd64 YYYY-MM-DD \
  openxc7-toolchain-windows-amd64-YYYYMMDD.tgz package-win/BUILD-INFO.json
tar czhf openxc7-toolchain-windows-amd64-YYYYMMDD.tgz --mode=u+w -C package-win .
```

`nextpnr-xilinx.exe` is the same himbaechel uarch as the Linux and macOS
binaries (`--device`, `-o xdc=`, `-o fasm=`, `--report`). It is built without
an embedded Python interpreter: the tree has no `libpython3.11.dll` and no
`lib/python3.11`. `apio report` reads the JSON that nextpnr writes with
`--report`, the same on every platform. `fasm2frames` still runs under the
Windows Python apio already provides.

## Validating a package

Everything the CI gates on is a script you can run locally, which is the point:
a release is only as trustworthy as the checks you can reproduce.

```bash
scripts/validate-package.sh <package.tgz>
scripts/validate-package.sh <package.tgz> --wine
scripts/validate-package.sh <package.tgz> --parts "xc7a35tcpg236" --keep
scripts/validate-package.sh <tools-only-tree-or-tarball> --chipdb-dir <bins>
```

A release package already carries its chipdb. The gate checks that every
file named by `XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json` is in `chipdb/`, that no extra `.bin`
is there, and that `chipdb/chipdb-id.txt` matches the index's `chipdb-id`.
`--chipdb-dir` is only for a local `--no-chipdb` tree: the same check, then
the bins are copied in so the end-to-end run has them. When the package
already ships the files, the flag is ignored.

It validates the package **inside its tarball** (never the freshly built tree)
and exits non-zero on any failure:

- the layout, and that every part of `chipdb-parts.json` is named by
  `XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json` and present in `chipdb/`;
- `--version` of the *packaged* binary against the revision in
  `nix/nextpnr-xilinx.nix`, so a stale binary cannot sneak into a release;
- on macOS, the ad-hoc signature and that no Mach-O load command still points
  into `/nix/store`;
- an end-to-end run for **every** part: synthesis → `nextpnr-xilinx` with the
  command line apio runs for the package's engine (for the himbaechel uarch:
  `--device <part> --chipdb chipdb-<die>.bin -o xdc=… -o fasm=… --report …`),
  whose `--report` JSON must carry `fmax` and `utilization` → `fasm2frames`,
  which must not print a single warning → `xc7frames2bit` → a real, non-empty
  bitstream.

That last step is also available on its own:

```bash
e2e/run-parts.sh <extracted-package-dir> <workdir> [wine]
```

The second layer is the **regression suite**: 23 declarative tests (one
folder + `test.json` each) that run real designs through the whole flow on
every packaged family — primitives, structural properties, a parametric
congestion pair, and the untouched upstream demo projects — and compare
fmax/utilisation/router-time against per-platform baselines. The harness
reads the engine from the package's `XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json` and speaks its
command line; `regress/baselines/<platform>.json` belongs to the engine this
repository packages:

```bash
scripts/fetch-demos.sh                              # locked third-party sources
scripts/regress.sh <package.tgz>                        # the whole catalogue
scripts/regress.sh <pkg> --test srl --json report.json
scripts/regress.sh <tools-only-pkg> --chipdb-dir <bins>
```

A third check keeps the installers honest about what is actually published:

```bash
scripts/check-versions.sh            # promoted release vs apio's remote-config
```

## Releases and CI

Each platform has its own reusable workflow, on its own native runner, carrying
the same gate. They are `workflow_call`-only consumers of the chipdb artifacts:
`build-pre-release.yaml` is the one entry point, and a validated package of any
branch is a dispatch of it on that branch:

| Workflow | What it does |
|---|---|
| `test.yaml` | Per-commit compile test: linux, macos and windows-cross jobs (push/PR guard) |
| `chipdb.yml` | Owns chipdb generation/cache, identity and `XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json`: one `chipdb-<die>.bin` per die of the manifest, generated three at a time under a memory budget so the two biggest dies never run together on the 16 GB runner |
| `linux-package.yml` | Consumes the chipdb artifacts, then builds + validates `linux-x86-64` |
| `darwin-package.yml` | Consumes the chipdb artifacts, then builds + validates `darwin-arm64` |
| `windows-package.yml` | Consumes the chipdb artifacts, then cross-builds + validates `windows-amd64` under wine (an inline E2E with the himbaechel command line and its `--report`, then L1 and L2) |
| `build-pre-release.yaml` | Daily orchestrator (FPGAwars convention): prepares chipdb, builds the three platforms, then publishes |
| `make-pre-release-stable.yaml` | Manual dispatch: re-verifies a candidate and marks it stable + latest (apio's remote-config is then updated by hand) |

`build-pre-release.yaml` creates the release **only after every platform is
green**, as a dated **prerelease** (never "latest"), with six assets: the
three tarballs (each carrying its chipdb), `XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json`,
`BUILD-INFO.json`, and a `SHA256SUMS` covering the other five
(written in the publishing job from the bytes it uploads, so it cannot drift
from the release). Before the upload, the index is checked against the bins
inside every tarball. There is no `apio-xilinx-chipdb-*.bin.tgz` asset.

`XILINX-PARTS-INDEX.json` is published under the same name every package carries it
at its root: which release it belongs to is written inside it (`release-tag`),
so the file name does not repeat the date. It is keyed by the full part number
(`xc7a200tfbg484-3`: device, package, speed grade) and says, for each one,
whether this release built it and — if it did — the chipdb file in `chipdb/`
(`chipdb-<die>.bin`; the parts of one die repeat that name). Parts the
packaged prjxray database supports but the release did not build are listed
with `"generated": false`: supported, not built, so apio can tell that from
"unknown part". A package carries one engine, and the schema number is the
contract. Schema 8, which this package emits, is the himbaechel engine,
installed as `nextpnr-xilinx`, one chipdb file per die, shipped in the
package. The command line is `nextpnr-xilinx --device <part> --chipdb
<file> -o xdc=… -o fasm=… --report …`. apio 1.6.x reads schema 5 only;
schema 8 is for the apio 1.7 line. Each platform's L1 and L2 gates run on
the tarball with those bins already inside it. Old prereleases are
pruned automatically; promoting a candidate to a real release is a deliberate
one-click human step, and everything after that click is automated.

Asset names must match the release tag: apio derives the package date from the
**tag** (`2026-07-31` → `20260731`), not from the file name, so a mismatch turns
into a 404 at install time.

### Rebuilding today's tag

`build-pre-release.yaml` replaces a same-tag **pre-release** only at the end of
the run, after every platform is green. That delete-and-publish window is about
50 seconds. Deleting the GitHub release by hand before dispatching opens a gap
of hours while the three platforms rebuild, and every installer that follows
that tag gets a 404.

To rebuild an existing tag without leaving anyone without a package:

1. **Do not delete the release.** If it is already a pre-release, leave it. If
   it is stable, mark it as a pre-release first (GitHub moves `latest` back to
   the previous stable). A still-stable tag makes the workflow fail on purpose.
2. Dispatch `build-pre-release.yaml` with that date. Set `regenerate_chipdb` to
   true to generate every chipdb die from scratch (no cache). The existing
   pre-release stays up until the last minute.
3. Wait for the run to finish green: the dated pre-release is then the newly
   validated packages.
4. Re-promote with `make-pre-release-stable.yaml` (and bump apio's remote-config
   by hand if clients install this tag).

Never delete `latest`, and never delete a release that apio's remote-config
already points at: that is an immediate 404 for every installer on that
channel.

### Bumping yosys

The CI validates every package with the yosys of a
[YosysHQ oss-cad-suite-build](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build)
release, and each package declares that release as the `yosys-release-tag` of
its `BUILD-INFO.json`. It is named in exactly one place: `YOSYS_RELEASE_TAG` in
`.github/workflows/build-pre-release.yaml` (`YYYY-MM-DD`). The suite is
downloaded from YosysHQ by that tag; the `yosys-release-tag` of the package is
derived from the installed suite's `VERSION` file, so no yosys date is written
anywhere else.

apio checks at run time that this package and its own `oss-cad-suite` package
name the same yosys tag, so a bump is coordinated with the apio maintainer:
`tools-oss-cad-suite` has to repackage the same YosysHQ release.

1. Change `YOSYS_RELEASE_TAG` to the YosysHQ release to validate against.
2. Run `test.yaml` on the branch, or dispatch `build-pre-release`.
3. If the new yosys synthesises differently, the L2 regression gate fails on
   metric drift. That is the gate working, not a broken bump: review the drift,
   then record the new numbers with `scripts/regress-baseline-from-report.py`
   from the `regress-report-<platform>` artifacts of that run (every baseline
   entry records the yosys it was measured with in `env.yosys`).
4. Open the PR (workflow change + regrabbed baselines).

`scripts/check-versions.sh` compares the literal with the yosys tag of the
`oss-cad-suite` release apio's remote-config names. The yosys tag of any
`tools-oss-cad-suite` release is the `YOSYS_RELEASE_TAG` of its workflow at
that git tag (and the "Underlying Yosys release" link of its release notes).
`scripts/ci-install-oss-cad-suite.sh` has no default version and refuses to
continue if the suite on disk is not the requested release.

### Running the workflows on a fork

The workflows run on a fork as they do here and publish the dated
pre-release on the fork itself, the way the other Apio packages do; that is
the way to test a change end to end before opening a PR. Dispatch
`build-pre-release.yaml` on the branch you want to test; it needs no
configuration on the fork.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `flake.nix`, `nix/` | The reproducible build: every package, the dev shells and the Windows cross recipe |
| `openxc7-pack.py`, `pack/`, `macpack.py` | The packer: a thin CLI over the `pack/` modules (unit-tested in `tests/`); the macOS backend relocates Mach-O libraries and re-signs them |
| `chipdb-parts.json` | The part manifest (family → footprints) — one line here per new part |
| `regress/` | The declarative regression suite (tests, baselines, locked third-party demos) |
| `scripts/`, `e2e/` | Validation you can run locally, and the multi-part end-to-end |
| — | End-user install scripts live on `archive/standalone-installers` (this is an apio package) |
| `udev/` | USB rules needed to program boards on Linux (copy of openFPGALoader's) |
| `example/`, `config/` | The Basys3 LED example and board constraint files |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI: guards, per-platform packages, release |
