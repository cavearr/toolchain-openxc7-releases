"""Expectations: turning what a test declared into pass/fail findings.

Every entry of a test's `expect` block dispatches to one function here. Adding
a new kind of expectation is therefore one function plus its key in
`spec.EXPECT_KEYS` — the engine and the tests themselves stay untouched.

A check returns the list of things that went wrong; an empty list means it
held.
